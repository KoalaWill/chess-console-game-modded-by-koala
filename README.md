# chess-console-game-modded-by-koala
 This is a chess console game forked from https://github.com/jeromevonk/chess_console and slightly changed by me

<br />

## How to use it....
 Just call the exe file in the build folder 
 
<br />

## How to change it....
 1. Fork it, or download it(of course)
 2. run
    ```
    cmake CmakeLists.txt
    ```
 3.
    if it mentions error about the file directory, delete the catche file and run the command above again
 4. 
    build it or press "F7"
 5. got to the build folder
 6. run it. ( I mean, it is quite obvious )
